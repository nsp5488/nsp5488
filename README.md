# Hey, I'm Nick Patel

- I'm a software engineer with 2 years of work experience developing fullstack Salesforce Applications in Apex (Similar to Java)
- I love Python for its amazing ecosystem, especially Torch for data science and ML projects
- I've recently been enjoying Go for anything that involves the web, and I'm hoping to use it for more of my projects
